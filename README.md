This script facilitates the dynamic creation of Google Forms tailored to specific data tables by providing parameters such as a unique identifier (key), table name (tableName), and recipient email address (email). Upon initialization, the script generates a Google Form with fields corresponding to the columns of the specified table. Subsequent form submissions are automatically processed and stored in the designated table. Additionally, it generates a QR code for easy access to the form, included in an email sent to the provided email address.
